A speech-to-data platform for real-time media analysis (100% in ideation).

## Ideas

- Home page sort of looks like the home page for a [insert streaming service here] app on Apple TV, where there are clips and previews of all the stuff that's streaming right now (Dana Bash on CNN, Anderson Cooper, Tucker Carlson on Fox News, a football game/pregame/postmatch).
- Click into a stream, say, a presidential debate, viewer sees a real-time speech-based analysis of how the topic is being covered. [A little bit of visual inspo](http://brtacks.github.io/foundations)
- In a big, media-wide topic like the Brett Kavanaugh hearing, the platform could show a real-time speech-based analysis of how digital news media covers the topic.
- Long term, platform could watch and store all streamed data to allow for real research into how digital news media covers different topics. Inspo: [Media Cloud](https://mediacloud.org).
